# JavaConcurrrency
Threads, Deadlocks, Locks, Synchronization to create a multi-threading environment.
Concurrency is one of the ost important aspect of programming language like java.
Java provides different mechanism to create multi-threading application which can do more than one task almost at a same time.
There are also some pitfalls of multi-threading like deadlocks(Race conditions) java also provides a way to tackle it down.
I had written code covering all of these concepts.
